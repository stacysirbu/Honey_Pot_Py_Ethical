# ðŸŽ¯ HoneyPotPy â€” Python Honeypot for Cybersecurity Training

A Python-based **low-interaction honeypot** designed to detect, log, and analyze unauthorized access attempts.  
Built for ethical **cybersecurity research**, SOC training, and attacker behavior analysis.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project simulates vulnerable network services to attract and log attacker activity in a controlled lab environment.  
Itâ€™s intended for:
- SOC analysts practicing real-time incident response.
- Threat intelligence gathering.
- Purple-team exercises to observe attacker tactics.

**Why It Matters**  
Honeypots are a powerful defensive tool. They:
- Waste attacker resources.
- Capture valuable intelligence on malicious behavior.
- Help defenders understand current attack trends.

By simulating a target, defenders can log every move the adversary makes â€” without risking production systems.
